# Module 1 Final Project

## Introduction

For this project we looked at data on the movie industry from sources including IMDB, TMDB, Box OFfice Mojo and Rotten Tomatoes.

## Objectives

I looked to answer the following questions:

* What are the top grossing movies?
* How much do they cost to make?
* What genres do the best at the box office?
* What movies/genres are the highest rated?

## The Project

I used data on the top grossing movies and movie budgets to determine the most profitable movies and genres. I also looked into smaller budgets to see what movies a newer production company with a smaller budget starting out could make. I also looked into movie rating data among films with a large number of ratings to see the top rated movies and whether this lines up with the top grossing films. Finally, I looked to take a general view of the most profitable types of movies i.e. genre and MPA rating.
